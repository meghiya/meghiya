👋 Hey there! I’m @meghiya, an enthusiastic food scientist with a biotechnology background! 
🍽️🧪 I’m deeply passionate about the fascinating worlds of fermentation and food metabolomics – exploring the flavors hidden within our foods!

💼 Beyond the lab, I'm also engaged by entrepreneurship! 
💡 I thrive on creating engaging content and serving as the communication hub for budding entrepreneurs, especially in the field of synthetic biology.
🚀 My mission? To inspire more people to take the leap into entrepreneurship at least once in their lives!

🌱 Currently, I’m diving headfirst into the realms of data analysis and visualization - because who doesn't love a bit of efficiency and insight, right? 😄

📫 Want to connect? Drop me a line at meghiyamichelle@Gmail.com – I’d love to chat about all things food science, entrepreneurship, and beyond!
